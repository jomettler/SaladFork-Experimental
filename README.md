# SaladFork-Experimental
Repository for Mods by me for the SaladFork 3D Printer

This is a developement repository. Assume that all uploads are untested. There is absolutely no warranty on anything. 

Feel free to open issues or contact me directly in case you find any bugs.

ALSO: Some Mods contain Parts at least partly designed by ANNEX-ENGINEERING (http://annex-engineering.com) I am not allowed to include these parts in my CAD, and their License applies to their designs. Due to this, these Parts are uploaded always in a sub-dir with their License File, which you should read carefully. I hate it, but I donÂ´t have the time to do everything on my own and their designs are certainly better than a lot of stuff out there.
